# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will churn based on historical data from a telecom company. Built as a full machine learning pipeline project, it demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, interpretability, and deployment.

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost
- SHAP for model explainability
- Streamlit for deployment

## Folder Structure
- `data/` - Raw dataset
- `notebooks/` - EDA, modeling code
- `models/` - Saved trained model
- `app/` - Deployment files

## Dataset
Source: [Kaggle - Telco Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## Objective
Classify customers as **churned** or **not churned** and deploy a prediction web app.
